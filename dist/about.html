            Hi everyone! My name is Abhinav and I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley
            studying EECS (Electrical Engineering & Computer Science) and
            Business Administration in the M.E.T. program. Personally, I like
            anything related to basketball, music, and teaching. When it comes
            to my work, I love dealing with products, where I can use my
            understanding of technology and business to tackle difficult
            challenges. Check out my resume if you want to see what I'm up to in
            the school year!

          <h3>Basketball</h3>
          <p>
            I've been a huge basketball fan ever since 2007. As my friends can
            attest, my favorite NBA player is Kevin Durant and I can back that
            up with the numerous bobbleheads, t-shirts, and posters related to
            KD in my room. The reason I like basketball so much is because it is
            a sport that is defined by analytics but not determined by it. With
            analytics and strategy, I see it as a game of chess played out on
            the court.

          <h3>Music</h3>
          <p>
            Raised in Houston, Texas, I grew up surrounded by football and
            marching band. Given my inability to catch or throw, I explored the
            latter and realized that I enjoyed music, specifically playing the
            clarinet. From the marching band performances to the full orchestra
            concerts, I've found that some of my most lasting memories have come
            from music, and I hope to continue it in the future.

        <div class="job job-3">
          <h3>Teaching</h3>
          <p>
            As much as I enjoy learning new things, I must say that I also love
            teaching just as much. I've found that in order to teach well, you
            truly need to understand an idea and transmit your method of
            understanding in a clear and effective manner, which can be tougher
            than it sounds. I'm a part of course staff for CS 61A this semester,
            so feel free to check out my 61A page if you need some help with the
            content!
